## How to use
Follow instructions from the ```datascape-template``` folder's [README](https://github.com/jacomyma/add-datascapes/tree/main/datascape-template). I recommend that you duplicate that folder before you change it.

Those instructions suppose that you already have set up:
* An ElasticSearch engine containing the documents to display
* A CSV file containing the words or expressions extracted from those files, and their coordinates in the basemap.
